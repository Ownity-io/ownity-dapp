        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Additionally, we work with advertisers, advertising agencies, advertisement networks, and other information technology services (ITS) to display advertisements featuring the Service on other online services, such as websites and applications.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Thus, we may place advertisements via Google and Facebook that may be visible to you through their platform as well as other online websites and applications.

        <p>
          As part of this practice, we may build tracking technologies into our own Service – including our website and emails – as well as into our advertisements displayed on other online websites and applications.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Some of these tracking technologies may register your activities throughout time and across services for the purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant advertisements and/or other content to you (“Tailored Advertisements”).
        </p>
        <br>

        </p>
        <p>
          However, be mindful that there is consensus in the industry with respect to how online website and application operators should treat the “Do Not Track” signals
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Thus, unless and until the law is interpreted to mandate that Ownity do so, we do not monitor or take action with regard to “Do Not Track” signals.
