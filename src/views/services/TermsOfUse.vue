          amending these Terms, we commit to using reasonable measures to notify you of such changes, such as by
          providing notice via the interface of the Service or updating the “Effective as of” date at the beginning of these Terms.

          hereunder and be subject to these Terms), your use of certain parts of the Service may be subject to the Supplemental Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will either add such Supplemental Terms to the Terms page of the Website or present them to you for your acceptance when you visit a part
          of the Service that is governed by such Supplemental Terms.
          These Supplemental Terms then become part of your Agreement with Ownity if you proceed to use those parts of the Service.

        <p class="term-title">4. SERVICE AS AN INTERFACE ONLY</p>
        <p>
          <b>To be absolutely clear, the Service merely provides a convenient interface that enables you, as a
          separate actor or in a group with other users, to access and interact with the</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Protocols deployed on the Ethereum blockchain network, with possible other blockchain networks.
          The Protocols allow you to perform actions with NFTs such as, among others, the purchase and sale of NFTs
          or fNFTs as a group, as well as the purchase and sale of NFTs, fNFTs, or NFT fractions as a separate actor.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Although Ownity operates the Service, we have no ownership, control, or supervision of the Protocols. We do not operate,
          administer, maintain, improve, or update any of the Protocols.</b> The Protocols are publicly accessible, automated, immutable,
          self-verifying, and self-executing pieces of code that together set up an infrastructure layer running on top of the distributed ledger of a
          given blockchain network and that will remain fully functional at all times as long as the blockchain stays in operation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Therefore, Ownity doesn’t make or attempt to make any representations
          or warranties concerning the security, safety, or functionality of the Protocols.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This means that by using the Service to interact with the Protocols, you acknowledge and agree that
        </p>
        <br>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A. there are inherent risks arising from the use of the Protocol
          </li>
          <li>
            B. your use of the Protocols in any manner is at your own risk;

          <b>Please gain a sufficient understanding of the function of the Protocols before using the Service in any way.</b> If you do not understand how the Protocols work,
          you are strongly advised against accessing the Service which may involve interaction with the Protocols.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Service is one of, yet not the sole, means for interaction with the Protocols,
          as any person or entity can create a program or service capable of interacting with the Protocols
          as well as access the Protocols by means of a block explorer, e.g. etherscan.io or other Third-Party Offering (defined below).

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          You should be vigilant and exercise caution and sound judgment in your interactions with other users and
          third-party sellers in order to keep yourself and your property out of danger at all times. You should be as
          careful with other users as you would be when interacting with any other strange person. OWNITY’S DIRECTORS,
          OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, SUBSIDIARIES,
          AFFILIATES, OR LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT – WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE –

        <p class="term-title">6. ALL BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS ARE FINAL</p>
        <p>
          <b>We DO NOT run and have no control of or influence over the Ethereum blockchain network or any other public blockchain
          network that you are interacting with, including any interaction between you and the Protocols that may be essential to your
          ability to complete transactions thereon, and hence we have no ability to undo, reverse, cancel, or alter any transaction effectuated on thereon.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Due to the nature of blockchain technology, the transactions of purchase, sale, or transfer of any Digital Assets successfully
          effectuated through a blockchain are irreversible. As a result, such Digital Assets may not be returned and
          no refund will be issued for the payment and any attendant transaction (i.e., a blockchain’s “gas” fee) costs.
        </p>

          Co-Owners of an fNFT can also take a vote on whether to cancel any of the ongoing ballots involving their fNFTs.

        <br>
        <p class="term-title">9. SERVICE FEES AND PAYMENT POLICY</p>
        <p>
          Ownity employs blockchain technology for the purpose of facilitating transactions. We may receive certain fees to
          a digital wallet that we own (“Service Fees”) for the transactions of purchase, sale, or transfer of Digital Assets
          that the Service has facilitated. The automatic transfer and our subsequent reception of
          such Service Fees may be effected or facilitated by the Protocols as well as other technology.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Protocols will only cause or facilitate the automatic transfer of the Service
          Fee in the event the user’s purchase, sale, or transfer transaction has been successfully
          completed on the blockchain network, i.e. the transaction has been included in a block and thereby
          officially verified and recorded in the blockchain. The transaction is recorded in the blockchain so long as
          it receives the minimum required number of confirmations from the validator nodes participating in the blockchain network.
          At this point, the transaction can no longer be reversed
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Ownity is not a party to any sales or transfers between Sellers and Buyers.</b> Contracts of sale are signed directly between Sellers and Buyers via the Protocols. Ownity merely facilitates these sales or transfers of Digital Assets by way of enabling the Service. You understand and agree that Ownity per se does not process any transactions involving Digital Assets and so it is not a separate and discrete service that Ownity offers alongside the Service.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>The Service Fees are subject to change.</b> Occasionally, depending on the financial performance of the Service or other subjective judgments, we may change the Service Fees by uploading the modified version of the Service to the Website. The revised Service Fees will enter into force once the updated Service is uploaded to the Website.

          <b>The amounts you pay hereunder are not inclusive of any Sales Tax that may be due pertaining to any part of the Service provided hereunder.</b> If we determine we have a legal obligation to collect Sales Tax from our users in connection with these Terms, we shall collect such Sales Tax as well as the amounts required hereunder.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          For purposes of this section, “<b>Sales Tax</b>” shall mean any sales and/or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
